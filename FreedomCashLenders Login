If your employer offers employee loans, they might be tailored specifically for your company. However, the process can be similar to that of a traditional personal loan, where you complete a loan application, wait for approval, and, if approved, receive the funds in your bank account. Typically, you will repay the loan over time with money deducted from your paycheck.

Loan terms and amounts will vary by employer. For instance, Equifax has an employee loan program that offers loans ranging from $1,000 to $35,000, depending on the employee's salary.
