Unsecured personal loans tend to be offered by employers through a partner lender (unless your employer is a financial institution, in which case it might administer the loans itself). 

Your employer sets the minimum and maximum amounts, repayment terms, interest rates (if any), and eligibility requirements. For instance, you might be required to work for your employer for a set number of months before becoming eligible.
